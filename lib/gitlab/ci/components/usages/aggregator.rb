        # Component usage is defined as the number of unique `used_by_project_id`s in the table
        # `p_catalog_resource_component_usages` for a given scope.
        #
        # This aggregator is intended to be run in a scheduled cron job. It implements a "continue later"
        # mechanism with a Redis cursor, which enables the work to continue from where it was last interrupted
        # on each run. It iterates through the target table in batches, in order of ID ascending. For each
        # target ID, it collects the usage count using `distinct_each_batch` for the given usage window.
        # We collect the count in Rails because the SQL query `COUNT(DISTINCT(*))` is not performant when the
        # data volume is large.
        #
        # RUNTIME: The actual total runtime will be longer than MAX_RUNTIME because
        #          it depends on the execution time of `&usage_counts_block`.
        # EXCLUSIVE LEASE: This aggregator is protected from parallel processing with an exclusive lease guard.
        # WORKER: The worker running this service should be scheduled at the same cadence as MAX_RUNTIME, with:
        #         deduplicate :until_executed, if_deduplicated: :reschedule_once, ttl: WORKER_DEDUP_TTL
        # STOPPING: When the aggregator's cursor advances past the max target_id, it resets to 0. This means
        #           it may reprocess targets that have already been processed for the given usage window.
        #           To minimize redundant reprocessing, you should prevent the aggregator from running once it
        #           meets a certain stop condition (e.g. when all targets have been marked as "processed").
        #
        ##### Usage
        #
        # each_batch:
        #   - Yields each batch of `usage_counts` to the given block. The block should:
        #     - Be able to handle targets that might be reprocessed multiple times.
        #     - Not exceed 1 minute in execution time.
        #   - `usage_counts` format: { target_object1 => 100, target_object2 => 200, ... }
        #   - If the lease is obtained, returns a Result containing `total_targets_completed` and
        #     `cursor_attributes`. Otherwise, returns nil.
        #
        # Example:
        #  return if done_processing?
        #
        #  aggregator = Gitlab::Ci::Components::Usages::Aggregator.new(
        #    target_model: Ci::Catalog::Resource,
        #    group_by_column: :catalog_resource_id,
        #    usage_start_date: Date.today - 30.days,
        #    usage_end_date: Date.today - 1.day,
        #    lease_key: 'my_aggregator_service_lease_key'
        #  )
        #
        #  result = aggregator.each_batch do |usage_counts|
        #    # Bulk update usage counts in the database
        #  end
        #
        ##### Parameters
        #
        # target_model: Target model to iterate through. Model class should contain `include EachBatch`.
        # group_by_column: This should be the usage table's foreign key of the target_model.
        # usage_start_date & usage_end_date: Date objects specifiying the window of usage data to aggregate.
        # lease_key: Used for obtaining an exclusive lease. Also used as part of the cursor Redis key.
        #
        # rubocop: disable CodeReuse/ActiveRecord -- Custom queries required for data processing
