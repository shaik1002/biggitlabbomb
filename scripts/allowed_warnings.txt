\*\*\*\* .+ had the following warning\(s\):

# As of Ruby 3.1, one-line typesafe/destructuring pattern matching via "rightward assignment" has
# been included for multiple years with no significant negative feedback or indications of removal.
# In the event that it is removed in a future Ruby release, the changes required to fix it are
# isolated and minor, and will have no fundamental effect on the logic. See the section
# "Rightward assignment pattern matching and destructuring with types" in
# ee/lib/remote_development/README.md for more information and context.
warning: One-line pattern matching is experimental, and the behavior may change in future versions of Ruby!
