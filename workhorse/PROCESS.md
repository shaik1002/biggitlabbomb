# GitLab-Workhorse development process

## Merging and reviewing contributions

Contributions must be reviewed by at least one Workhorse maintainer.
The final merge must be performed by a maintainer.

It is preferable to request a review from a reviewer or a trainee maintainer before passing it to a maintainer:

- [Maintainers](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?mode=show&visible=maintainer%7Cworkhorse)
- [Trainee Maintainers](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?mode=show&visible=trainee+maintainer%7Cworkhorse)
- [Reviewers](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-roulette/?mode=show&visible=reviewer%7Cworkhorse)
