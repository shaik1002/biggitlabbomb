# Installation system requirements

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed

This page includes information about the minimum requirements you need to install and use GitLab.

## Hardware requirements

### Storage

The necessary hard drive space largely depends on the size of the repositories you want to store in GitLab but as a *guideline* you should have at least as much free space as all your repositories combined take up.

The Linux package requires about 2.5 GB of storage space for installation.

If you want to be flexible about growing your hard drive space in the future consider mounting it using [logical volume management (LVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_volume_management) so you can add more hard drives when you need them.

Apart from a local hard drive you can also mount a volume that supports the network file system (NFS) protocol. This volume might be located on a file server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, a storage area network (SAN) or on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume.

If you have enough RAM and a recent CPU the speed of GitLab is mainly limited by hard drive seek times. Having a fast drive (7200 RPM and up) or a solid state drive (SSD) improves the responsiveness of GitLab.

NOTE:
Because file system performance may affect the overall performance of GitLab,
[we don't recommend using cloud-based file systems for storage](../administration/nfs.md#avoid-using-cloud-based-file-systems).

NOTE:
[NFS for Git repository storage is deprecated](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-0-released/#nfs-for-git-repository-storage-deprecated). See our official [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#gitaly-and-nfs) for further information.

### CPU

CPU requirements are dependent on the number of users and expected workload. Your exact needs may be more, depending on your workload. Your workload is influenced by factors such as - but not limited to - how active your users are, how much automation you use, mirroring, and repository/change size.

Refer below for CPU recommendations depending on user count / load:

- Up to 20 Requests per Second (RPS) or 1000 users - 8 vCPU.
- More users or load? Consult the [reference architectures page](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md).

### Memory

Memory requirements are dependent on the number of users and expected workload. Your exact needs may be more, depending on your workload. Your workload is influenced by factors such as - but not limited to - how active your users are, how much automation you use, mirroring, and repository/change size.

Refer below for Memory recommendations depending on user count / load:

- Up to 20 Requests per Second (RPS) or 1000 users - 8 GB (Minimum), 16 GB (Recommended).
- More users or load? Consult the [reference architectures page](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md).

NOTE:
While not recommended, in certain circumstances GitLab may run in a [memory constrained environment](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/memory_constrained_envs.html).

## Database

PostgreSQL is the only supported database, which is bundled with the Linux package.
You can also use an [external PostgreSQL database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#using-a-non-packaged-postgresql-database-management-server).

### PostgreSQL Requirements

The server running PostgreSQL should have _at least_ 5-10 GB of storage
available, though the exact requirements [depend on the number of users](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md). For Ultimate customers the server should have _at least_ 12 GB of storage available, as 1 GB of vulnerability data needs to be imported.

We highly recommend using at least the minimum PostgreSQL versions (as specified in
the following table) as these were used for development and testing:

| GitLab version | Minimum PostgreSQL version<sup>1</sup> | Maximum PostgreSQL version<sup>2</sup> |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 13.0           | 11                                     | <sup>2</sup>                                       |
| 14.0           | 12.7                                   | <sup>2</sup>                                       |
| 15.0           | 12.10                                  | 13.x (14.x<sup>3</sup>)                |
| 16.0           | 13.6                                   | 15.x<sup>4</sup>                       |
| 17.0 (planned) | 14.9                                   | 15.x<sup>4</sup>                       |

1. PostgreSQL minor release upgrades (for example 14.8 to 14.9) [include only bug and security fixes](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).
   Patch levels in this table are not prescriptive. Always deploy the most recent patch level
   to avoid [known bugs in PostgreSQL that might be triggered by GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/364763).
1. If you want to run a later major release of PostgreSQL than the specified minimum
   [check if a more recent version shipped with Linux package (Omnibus) GitLab](http://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/licenses.html).
   `postgresql-new` is a later version that's definitely supported.
1. PostgreSQL 14.x [tested against GitLab 15.11 only](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/114624).
1. [Tested against GitLab 16.1 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/119344).

You must also ensure the following extensions are loaded into every
GitLab database. [Read more about this requirement, and troubleshooting](postgresql_extensions.md).

| Extension    | Minimum GitLab version |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `pg_trgm`    | 8.6                    |
| `btree_gist` | 13.1                   |
| `plpgsql`    | 11.7                   |

The following managed PostgreSQL services are known to be incompatible and should not be used:

| GitLab version | Managed service                                       |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 14.4+          | Amazon Aurora (see [14.4.0](../update/versions/gitlab_14_changes.md#1440)) |

#### Additional requirements for GitLab Geo

If you're using [GitLab Geo](../administration/geo/index.md), we strongly recommend running instances installed by using the Linux package or using
[validated cloud-managed instances](../administration/reference_architectures/index.md#recommended-cloud-providers-and-services),
as we actively develop and test based on those.
We cannot guarantee compatibility with other external databases.

It is recommended to review the [full requirements for running Geo](../administration/geo/index.md#requirements-for-running-geo).

#### Operating system locale compatibility and silent index corruption

Changes to locale data in `glibc` means that PostgreSQL database files are not fully compatible
between different OS releases.

To avoid index corruption, [check for locale compatibility](../administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting/common.md#check-os-locale-data-compatibility)
when:

- Moving binary PostgreSQL data between servers.
- Upgrading your Linux distribution.
- Updating or changing third party container images.

For more information, see how to [upgrade operating systems for PostgreSQL](../administration/postgresql/upgrading_os.md).

#### Gitaly Cluster database requirements

[Read more in the Gitaly Cluster documentation](../administration/gitaly/praefect.md).

#### Exclusive use of GitLab databases

Databases created or used for GitLab, Geo, Gitaly Cluster, or other components should be for the
exclusive use of GitLab. Do not make direct changes to the database, schemas, users, or other
properties except when following procedures in the GitLab documentation or following the directions
of GitLab Support or other GitLab engineers.

- The main GitLab application uses three schemas:

  - The default `public` schema
  - `gitlab_partitions_static` (automatically created)
  - `gitlab_partitions_dynamic` (automatically created)

  No other schemas should be manually created.

- GitLab may create new schemas as part of Rails database migrations. This happens when performing
  a GitLab upgrade. The GitLab database account requires access to do this.

- GitLab creates and modifies tables during the upgrade process, and also as part of standard
  operations to manage partitioned tables.

- You should not modify the GitLab schema (for example, adding triggers or modifying tables).
  Database migrations are tested against the schema definition in the GitLab codebase. GitLab
  version upgrades may fail if the schema is modified.

## Puma settings

The recommended settings for Puma are determined by the infrastructure on which it's running.
The Linux package defaults to the recommended Puma settings. Regardless of installation method, you can
tune the Puma settings:

- If you're using the Linux package, see [Puma settings](../administration/operations/puma.md)
  for instructions on changing the Puma settings.
- If you're using the GitLab Helm chart, see the
  [`webservice` chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/webservice/index.html).

### Puma workers

The recommended number of workers is calculated as the highest of the following:

- `2`
- A combination of CPU and memory resource availability (see how this is configured automatically for the [Linux package](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/blob/ef9facdc927e7389db6a5e0655414ba8318c7b8a/files/gitlab-cookbooks/gitlab/libraries/puma.rb#L31-46)).

Take for example the following scenarios:

- A node with 2 cores / 8 GB memory should be configured with **2 Puma workers**.

  Calculated as:

  ```plaintext
  The highest number from
  2
  And
  [
  the lowest number from
    - number of cores: 2
    - memory limit: (8 - 1.5) = 6.5
  ]
  ```

  So, the highest from 2 and 2 is 2.

- A node with 4 cores / 4 GB memory should be configured with **2 Puma workers**.

  ```plaintext
  The highest number from
  2
  And
  [
  the lowest number from
    - number of cores: 4
    - memory limit: (4 - 1.5) = 2.5
  ]
  ```

  So, the highest from 2 and 2 is 2.

- A node with 4 cores / 8 GB memory should be configured with **4 Puma workers**.

  ```plaintext
  The highest number from
  2
  And
  [
  the lowest number from
    - number of cores: 4
    - memory limit: (8 - 1.5) = 6.5
  ]
  ```

  So, the highest from 2 and 4 is 4.

You can increase the number of Puma workers, provided enough CPU and memory capacity is available.
A higher number of Puma workers usually helps to reduce the response time of the application
and increase the ability to handle parallel requests. You must perform testing to verify the
optimal settings for your infrastructure.

### Puma threads

The recommended number of threads is dependent on several factors, including total memory.

- If the operating system has a maximum 2 GB of memory, the recommended number of threads is `1`.
  A higher value results in excess swapping, and decrease performance.
- In all other cases, the recommended number of threads is `4`. We don't recommend setting this
  higher, due to how [Ruby MRI multi-threading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)
  works.

### Puma per worker maximum memory

By default, each Puma worker is limited to 1.2 GB of memory.
You can [adjust this memory setting](../administration/operations/puma.md#reducing-memory-use) and should do so
if you must increase the number of Puma workers.

## Redis

Redis stores all user sessions and the background task queue.

The requirements for Redis are as follows:

- Redis 6.x or 7.x is required in GitLab 16.0 and later. However, you should upgrade to
Redis 6.2 or later as [Redis 6.0 is no longer supported](https://endoflife.date/redis).
- Redis Cluster mode is not supported. Redis Standalone must be used, with or without HA.
- Storage requirements for Redis are minimal, about 25 kB per user on average.
- [Redis eviction mode](../administration/redis/replication_and_failover_external.md#setting-the-eviction-policy) set appropriately.

## Sidekiq

Sidekiq processes the background jobs with a multi-threaded process.
This process starts with the entire Rails stack (200 MB+) but it can grow over time due to memory leaks.
On a very active server (10,000 billable users) the Sidekiq process can use 1 GB+ of memory.

## Prometheus and its exporters

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and its related exporters are enabled by
default to enable in depth monitoring of GitLab. With default settings, these
processes consume approximately 200 MB of memory.

If you would like to disable Prometheus and it's exporters or read more information
about it, check the [Prometheus documentation](../administration/monitoring/prometheus/index.md).

## GitLab Runner

We strongly advise against installing GitLab Runner on the same machine you plan
to install GitLab on. Depending on how you decide to configure GitLab Runner and
what tools you use to exercise your application in the CI environment, GitLab
Runner can consume significant amount of available memory.

Memory consumption calculations, that are available above, are not valid if
you decide to run GitLab Runner and the GitLab Rails application on the same
machine.

It's also not safe to install everything on a single machine, because of the
[security reasons](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/security/), especially when you plan to use shell executor with GitLab
Runner.

We recommend using a separate machine for each GitLab Runner, if you plan to
use the CI features.
The GitLab Runner server requirements depend on:

- The type of [executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/) you configured on GitLab Runner.
- Resources required to run build jobs.
- Job concurrency settings.

Because the nature of the jobs varies for each use case, you must experiment by adjusting the job concurrency to get the optimum setting.

For reference, the [SaaS runners on Linux](../ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.md)
are configured so that a **single job** runs in a **single instance** with:

- 1 vCPU.
- 3.75 GB of RAM.

## Supported web browsers

GitLab supports the following web browsers:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/)
- [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?form=MA13FJ)

For the listed web browsers, GitLab supports:

- The current and previous major versions of browsers.
- The current minor version of a supported major version.

NOTE:
We don't support running GitLab with JavaScript disabled in the browser and have no plans of supporting that
in the future because we have features such as issue boards which require JavaScript extensively.

## Security

After installation, be sure to read and follow guidance on [maintaining a secure GitLab installation](../security/index.md).

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, for example `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
