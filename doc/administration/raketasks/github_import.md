# GitHub import Rake task (removed)

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390690) in GitLab 15.9, Rake task no longer automatically creates namespaces or groups that don't exist.
> - Requirement for Maintainer role instead of Developer role introduced in GitLab 16.0 and backported to GitLab 15.11.1 and GitLab 15.10.5.

This feature was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/134296) in GitLab 16.6 and [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/147182) in GitLab 17.0. Use the [GitHub import feature](../../user/project/import/github.md) instead.
