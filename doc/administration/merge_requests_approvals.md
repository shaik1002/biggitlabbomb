# Merge request approvals

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed

Merge request approval rules prevent users from overriding certain settings on the project level.
When enabled at the instance level, these settings
[cascade](../user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.md#cascade-settings-from-the-instance-or-top-level-group)
and can no longer be changed:

- In projects.
- In groups.

To enable merge request approval settings for an instance:

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin Area**.
1. Select **Push Rules**.
1. Expand **Merge request approvals**.
1. Choose the required options.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Available rules

Merge request approval settings that can be set at an instance level are:

- **Prevent approval by author**. Prevents project maintainers from allowing request authors to
  merge their own merge requests.
- **Prevent approvals by users who add commits**. Prevents project maintainers from allowing users
  to approve merge requests if they have submitted any commits to the source branch.
- **Prevent editing approval rules in projects and merge requests**. Prevents users from modifying
  the approvers list in project settings or in individual merge requests.

See also the following, which are affected by instance-level rules:

- [Project merge request approval rules](../user/project/merge_requests/approvals/index.md).
- [Group merge request approval settings](../user/group/manage.md#group-merge-request-approval-settings).
