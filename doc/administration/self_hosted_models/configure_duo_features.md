## Configure your GitLab instance

Prerequisites:

To configure your GitLab instance to access the AI Gateway:

1. Where your GitLab instance is installed, update the `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` file:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
   ```

1. Add and save the following environment variables:

   ```ruby
   gitlab_rails['env'] = {
   'GITLAB_LICENSE_MODE' => 'production',
   'CUSTOMER_PORTAL_URL' => 'https://customers.gitlab.com',
   'AI_GATEWAY_URL' => '<path_to_your_ai_gateway>:<port>'
   }
   ```

1. Run reconfigure:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
   ```
