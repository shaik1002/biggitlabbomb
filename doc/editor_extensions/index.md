# Editor and IDE extensions

GitLab has plugins and extensions to extend GitLab functionality to the following editors:

- [Visual Studio Code](visual_studio_code/index.md)
- [JetBrains IDEs](jetbrains_ide/index.md)
- [Visual Studio](visual_studio/index.md)
- [Neovim](neovim/index.md)

GitLab also supports developers in their command-line interface with [`glab`](gitlab_cli/index.md) the GitLab CLI.

## Features

A complete list of the features and capabilities of each extension can be found in the documentation home for each extension.
