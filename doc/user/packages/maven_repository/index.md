# Maven packages in the package registry

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

Publish [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) artifacts in your project's package registry.
Then, install the packages whenever you need to use them as a dependency.

For documentation of the specific API endpoints that the Maven package manager
client uses, see the [Maven API documentation](../../../api/packages/maven.md).

Supported clients:

- `mvn`. Learn how to build a [Maven](../workflows/build_packages.md#maven) package.
- `gradle`. Learn how to build a [Gradle](../workflows/build_packages.md#gradle) package.
- `sbt`.

## Publish to the GitLab package registry

### Authenticate to the package registry

You need a token to publish a package. There are different tokens available depending on what you're trying to achieve. For more information, review the [guidance on tokens](../package_registry/index.md#authenticate-with-the-registry).

Create a token and save it to use later in the process.

Do not use authentication methods other than the methods documented here. Undocumented authentication methods might be removed in the future.

#### Edit the client configuration

Update your configuration to authenticate to the Maven repository with HTTP.

##### Custom HTTP header

You must add the authentication details to the configuration file
for your client.

Authentication for [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html) is based on
[basic HTTP Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication).
You must to provide a name and a password.

NOTE:
The name field must be named to match the token you chose.

To install a package from the Maven GitLab package registry by using `sbt`, you must configure
a [Maven resolver](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Resolvers.html#Maven+resolvers).
If you're accessing a private or an internal project or group, you need to set up
[credentials](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Publishing.html#Credentials).
After configuring the resolver and authentication, you can install a package
from a project, group, or namespace.

In your [`build.sbt`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html#sbt+build+definition+files), add the following lines:

```scala
resolvers += ("gitlab" at "<endpoint url>")

credentials += Credentials("GitLab Packages Registry", "<host>", "<name>", "<token>")
```

In this example:

- `<endpoint url>` is the [endpoint URL](#endpoint-urls).
  Example: `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/maven`.
- `<host>` is the host present in the `<endpoint url>` without the protocol
  scheme or the port. Example: `gitlab.example.com`.
- `<name>` and `<token>` are explained in the table above.

::EndTabs

### Naming convention

You can use one of three endpoints to install a Maven package. You must publish a package to a project, but the endpoint you choose determines the settings you add to your `pom.xml` file for publishing.

The three endpoints are:

- **Project-level**: Use when you have a few Maven packages and they are not in the same GitLab group.
- **Group-level**: Use when you want to install packages from many different projects in the same GitLab group. GitLab does not guarantee the uniqueness of package names within the group. You can have two projects with the same package name and package version. As a result, GitLab serves whichever one is more recent.
- **Instance-level**: Use when you have many packages in different GitLab groups or in their own namespace.

For the instance-level endpoint, ensure the relevant section of your `pom.xml` in Maven looks like this:

```xml
  <groupId>group-slug.subgroup-slug</groupId>
  <artifactId>project-slug</artifactId>
```

**Only packages that have the same path as the project** are exposed by the instance-level endpoint.

| Project             | Package                          | Instance-level endpoint available |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `foo/bar`           | `foo/bar/1.0-SNAPSHOT`           | Yes                               |
| `gitlab-org/gitlab` | `foo/bar/1.0-SNAPSHOT`           | No                                |
| `gitlab-org/gitlab` | `gitlab-org/gitlab/1.0-SNAPSHOT` | Yes                               |

#### Endpoint URLs

| Endpoint | Endpoint URL for `pom.xml`                                               | Additional information |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Project  | `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/maven` | Replace `gitlab.example.com` with your domain name. Replace `<project_id>` with your project ID, found on your [project overview page](../../project/working_with_projects.md#access-the-project-overview-page-by-using-the-project-id). |
| Group    | `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/groups/<group_id>/-/packages/maven`   | Replace `gitlab.example.com` with your domain name. Replace `<group_id>` with your group ID, found on your group's homepage. |
| Instance | `https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/packages/maven`                       | Replace `gitlab.example.com` with your domain name. |

### Edit the configuration file for publishing

You must add publishing details to the configuration file for your client.

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

No matter which endpoint you choose, you must have:

- A project-specific URL in the `distributionManagement` section.
- A `repository` and `distributionManagement` section.

The relevant `repository` section of your `pom.xml` in Maven should look like this:

```xml
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>gitlab-maven</id>
    <url><your_endpoint_url></url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
<distributionManagement>
  <repository>
    <id>gitlab-maven</id>
    <url>https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/maven</url>
  </repository>
  <snapshotRepository>
    <id>gitlab-maven</id>
    <url>https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/maven</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
```

- The `id` is what you [defined in `settings.xml`](#edit-the-client-configuration).
- The `<your_endpoint_url>` depends on which [endpoint](#endpoint-urls) you choose.
- Replace `gitlab.example.com` with your domain name.

:::TabTitle `gradle`

To publish a package by using Gradle:

1. Add the Gradle plugin [`maven-publish`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) to the plugins section:

   - In Groovy DSL:

     ```groovy
     plugins {
         id 'java'
         id 'maven-publish'
     }
     ```

   - In Kotlin DSL:

     ```kotlin
     plugins {
         java
         `maven-publish`
     }
     ```

1. Add a `publishing` section:

   - In Groovy DSL:

     ```groovy
     publishing {
         publications {
             library(MavenPublication) {
                 from components.java
             }
         }
         repositories {
             maven {
                 url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/packages/maven"
                 credentials(HttpHeaderCredentials) {
                     name = "REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN_NAME"
                     value = gitLabPrivateToken // the variable resides in $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties
                 }
                 authentication {
                     header(HttpHeaderAuthentication)
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   - In Kotlin DSL:

     ```kotlin
     publishing {
         publications {
             create<MavenPublication>("library") {
                 from(components["java"])
             }
         }
         repositories {
             maven {
                 url = uri("https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<PROJECT_ID>/packages/maven")
                 credentials(HttpHeaderCredentials::class) {
                     name = "REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN_NAME"
                     value =
                         findProperty("gitLabPrivateToken") as String? // the variable resides in $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties
                 }
                 authentication {
                     create("header", HttpHeaderAuthentication::class)
                 }
             }
         }
     }

## Publish a package

WARNING:
Using the `DeployAtEnd` option can cause an upload to be rejected with `400 bad request {"message":"Validation failed: Name has already been taken"}`. For more details,
see [issue 424238](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/424238).

After you have set up the [authentication](#authenticate-to-the-package-registry)
and [chosen an endpoint for publishing](#naming-convention),
publish a Maven package to your project.

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

To publish a package by using Maven:

```shell
mvn deploy
```

If the deploy is successful, the build success message should be displayed:

```shell
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
...
```

The message should also show that the package was published to the correct location:

```shell
Uploading to gitlab-maven: https://example.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/packages/maven/com/mycompany/mydepartment/my-project/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-project-1.0-20200128.120857-1.jar
```

:::TabTitle `gradle`

Run the publish task:

```shell
gradle publish
```

Go to your project's **Packages and registries** page and view the published packages.

:::TabTitle `sbt`

Configure the `publishTo` setting in your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
publishTo := Some("gitlab" at "<endpoint url>")
```

Ensure the credentials are referenced correctly. See the [`sbt` documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Publishing.html#Credentials) for more information.

To publish a package using `sbt`:

```shell
sbt publish
```

If the deploy is successful, the build success message is displayed:

```shell
[success] Total time: 1 s, completed Jan 28, 2020 12:08:57 PM
```

Check the success message to ensure the package was published to the
correct location:

```shell
[info]  published my-project_2.12 to https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/packages/maven/com/mycompany/my-project_2.12/0.1.1-SNAPSHOT/my-project_2.12-0.1.1-SNAPSHOT.pom
```

::EndTabs

## Install a package

To install a package from the GitLab package registry, you must configure
the [remote and authenticate](#authenticate-to-the-package-registry).
When this is completed, you can install a package from a project,
group, or namespace.

If multiple packages have the same name and version, when you install
a package, the most recently-published package is retrieved.

In case there are not enough permissions to read the most recently-published
package than `403 Forbidden` is returning.

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

To install a package by using `mvn install`:

1. Add the dependency manually to your project `pom.xml` file.
   To add the example created earlier, the XML would be:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.mycompany.mydepartment</groupId>
     <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>
     <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

1. In your project, run the following:

   ```shell
   mvn install
   ```

The message should show that the package is downloading from the package registry:

```shell
Downloading from gitlab-maven: http://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/packages/maven/com/mycompany/mydepartment/my-project/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-project-1.0-20200128.120857-1.pom
```

You can also install packages by using the Maven [`dependency:get` command](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/get-mojo.html) directly.

1. In your project directory, run:

   ```shell
   mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.nickkipling.app:nick-test-app:1.1-SNAPSHOT -DremoteRepositories=gitlab-maven::::<gitlab endpoint url>  -s <path to settings.xml>
   ```

   - `<gitlab endpoint url>` is the URL of the GitLab [endpoint](#endpoint-urls).
   - `<path to settings.xml>` is the path to the `settings.xml` file that contains the [authentication details](#edit-the-client-configuration).

NOTE:
The repository IDs in the command(`gitlab-maven`) and the `settings.xml` file must match.

The message should show that the package is downloading from the package registry:

```shell
Downloading from gitlab-maven: http://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/PROJECT_ID/packages/maven/com/mycompany/mydepartment/my-project/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-project-1.0-20200128.120857-1.pom
```

:::TabTitle `gradle`

To install a package by using `gradle`:

1. Add a [dependency](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html) to `build.gradle` in the dependencies section:

   - In Groovy DSL:

     ```groovy
     dependencies {
         implementation 'com.mycompany.mydepartment:my-project:1.0-SNAPSHOT'
     }
     ```

   - In Kotlin DSL:

     ```kotlin
     dependencies {
         implementation("com.mycompany.mydepartment:my-project:1.0-SNAPSHOT")
     }
     ```

1. In your project, run the following:

   ```shell
   gradle install
   ```

:::TabTitle `sbt`

To install a package by using `sbt`:

1. Add an [inline dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Management.html#Dependencies) to `build.sbt`:

   ```scala
   libraryDependencies += "com.mycompany.mydepartment" % "my-project" % "8.4"
   ```

1. In your project, run the following:

   ```shell
   sbt update
   ```

## Helpful hints

### Publishing a package with the same name or version

When you publish a package with the same name and version as an existing package, the new package
files are added to the existing package. You can still use the UI or API to access and view the
existing package's older assets.

To delete older package versions, consider using the Packages API or the UI.

### Do not allow duplicate Maven packages

> - Required role [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/350682) from Developer to Maintainer in GitLab 15.0.
> - Required role [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/370471) from Maintainer to Owner in GitLab 17.0.

To prevent users from publishing duplicate Maven packages, you can use the [GraphQl API](../../../api/graphql/reference/index.md#packagesettings) or the UI.

In the UI:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > Packages and registries**.
1. In the **Maven** row of the **Duplicate packages** table, turn off the **Allow duplicates** toggle.
1. Optional. In the **Exceptions** text box, enter a regular expression that matches the names and versions of packages to allow.

Your changes are automatically saved.

By default this feature is not available for self-managed. To make it available, an administrator can [enable the feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `maven_central_request_forwarding`.
This feature is not available for GitLab.com or GitLab Dedicated users.

When a Maven package is not found in the package registry, the request is forwarded
to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).

When the feature flag is enabled, administrators can disable this behavior in the
[Continuous Integration settings](../../../administration/settings/continuous_integration.md).

Maven forwarding is restricted to only the project level and
group level [endpoints](#naming-convention). The instance level endpoint
has naming restrictions that prevent it from being used for packages that don't follow that convention and also
introduces too much security risk for supply-chain style attacks.

#### Additional configuration for `mvn`

When using `mvn`, there are many ways to configure your Maven project so that it requests packages
in Maven Central from GitLab. Maven repositories are queried in a
[specific order](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html#repository-order).
By default, Maven Central is usually checked first through the
[Super POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Super_POM), so
GitLab needs to be configured to be queried before maven-central.

To ensure all package requests are sent to GitLab instead of Maven Central,
you can override Maven Central as the central repository by adding a `<mirror>`
section to your `settings.xml`:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>central-proxy</id>
      <configuration>
        <httpHeaders>
          <property>
            <name>Private-Token</name>
            <value><personal_access_token></value>
          </property>
        </httpHeaders>
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>central-proxy</id>
      <name>GitLab proxy of central repo</name>
      <url>https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/maven</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
```

### Create Maven packages with GitLab CI/CD

After you have configured your repository to use the Package Repository for Maven,
you can configure GitLab CI/CD to build new packages automatically.

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

You can create a new package each time the default branch is updated.

1. Create a `ci_settings.xml` file that serves as Maven's `settings.xml` file.

1. Add the `server` section with the same ID you defined in your `pom.xml` file.
   For example, use `gitlab-maven` as the ID:

   ```xml
   <settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd">
     <servers>
       <server>
         <id>gitlab-maven</id>
         <configuration>
           <httpHeaders>
             <property>
               <name>Job-Token</name>
               <value>${CI_JOB_TOKEN}</value>
             </property>
           </httpHeaders>
         </configuration>
       </server>
     </servers>
   </settings>
   ```

1. Make sure your `pom.xml` file includes the following.
   You can either let Maven use the [predefined CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/predefined_variables.md), as shown in this example,
   or you can hard code your server's hostname and project's ID.

   ```xml
   <repositories>
     <repository>
       <id>gitlab-maven</id>
       <url>${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/maven</url>
     </repository>
   </repositories>
   <distributionManagement>
     <repository>
       <id>gitlab-maven</id>
       <url>${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/maven</url>
     </repository>
     <snapshotRepository>
       <id>gitlab-maven</id>
       <url>${CI_API_V4_URL}/projects/${CI_PROJECT_ID}/packages/maven</url>
     </snapshotRepository>
   </distributionManagement>
   ```

1. Add a `deploy` job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     image: maven:3.6-jdk-11
     script:
       - 'mvn deploy -s ci_settings.xml'
     rules:
       - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
   ```

1. Push those files to your repository.

The next time the `deploy` job runs, it copies `ci_settings.xml` to the
user's home location. In this example:

- The user is `root`, because the job runs in a Docker container.
- Maven uses the configured CI/CD variables.

:::TabTitle `gradle`

You can create a package each time the default branch
is updated.

1. Authenticate with [a CI job token in Gradle](#edit-the-client-configuration).

1. Add a `deploy` job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   deploy:
     image: gradle:6.5-jdk11
     script:
       - 'gradle publish'
     rules:
       - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
   ```

1. Commit files to your repository.

When the pipeline is successful, the Maven package is created.

### Version validation

The version string is validated by using the following regex.

```ruby
\A(?!.*\.\.)[\w+.-]+\z
```

You can experiment with the regex and try your version strings on [this regular expression editor](https://rubular.com/r/rrLQqUXjfKEoL6).

### Useful Maven command-line options

There are some [Maven command-line options](https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-embedder/cli.html)
that you can use when performing tasks with GitLab CI/CD.

- File transfer progress can make the CI logs hard to read.
  Option `-ntp,--no-transfer-progress` was added in
  [3.6.1](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.6.1/release-notes.html#User_visible_Changes).
  Alternatively, look at `-B,--batch-mode`
  [or lower level logging changes.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21638697/disable-maven-download-progress-indication)

- Specify where to find the `pom.xml` file (`-f,--file`):

  ```yaml
  package:
    script:
      - 'mvn --no-transfer-progress -f helloworld/pom.xml package'
  ```

- Specify where to find the user settings (`-s,--settings`) instead of
  [the default location](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html). There's also a `-gs,--global-settings` option:

  ```yaml
  package:
    script:
      - 'mvn -s settings/ci.xml package'
  ```

### Supported CLI commands

The GitLab Maven repository supports the following CLI commands:

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

- `mvn deploy`: Publish your package to the package registry.
- `mvn install`: Install packages specified in your Maven project.
- `mvn dependency:get`: Install a specific package.

:::TabTitle `gradle`

- `gradle publish`: Publish your package to the package registry.
- `gradle install`: Install packages specified in your Gradle project.

::EndTabs

## Troubleshooting

To improve performance, clients cache files related to a package. If you encounter issues, clear
the cache with these commands:

::Tabs

:::TabTitle `mvn`

```shell
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository
```

:::TabTitle `gradle`

```shell
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches # Or replace ~/.gradle with your custom GRADLE_USER_HOME
```

::EndTabs

### Review network trace logs

If you are having issues with the Maven Repository, you may want to review network trace logs.

For example, try to run `mvn deploy` locally with a PAT token and use these options:

```shell
mvn deploy \
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.wagon.providers.http.httpclient=trace \
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.wagon.providers.http.httpclient.wire=trace
```

WARNING:
When you set these options, all network requests are logged and a large amount of output is generated.

### Verify your Maven settings

If you encounter issues within CI/CD that relate to the `settings.xml` file, try adding
an additional script task or job to [verify the effective settings](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin/effective-settings-mojo.html).

The help plugin can also provide
[system properties](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-help-plugin/system-mojo.html), including environment variables:

```yaml
mvn-settings:
  script:
    - 'mvn help:effective-settings'

package:
  script:
    - 'mvn help:system'
    - 'mvn package'
```
