# Operational container scanning

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

> - [Deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/368828) the starboard directive in GitLab 15.4. The starboard directive is scheduled for removal in GitLab 16.0.

## Supported architectures

In GitLab agent for Kubernetes 16.10.0 and later and GitLab agent Helm Chart 1.25.0 and later, operational container scanning (OCS) is supported for `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64`. For earlier versions, only `linux/amd64` is supported.

## Enable operational container scanning

You can use OCS to scan container images in your cluster for security vulnerabilities.
In GitLab agent 16.9 and later, OCS uses a [wrapper image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/trivy-k8s-wrapper) around [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) to scan images for vulnerabilities.
Before GitLab 16.9, OCS directly used the [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) image.

OCS can be configured to run on a cadence by using `agent config` or a project's scan execution policy.

NOTE:
If both `agent config` and `scan execution policies` are configured, the configuration from `scan execution policy` takes precedence.

### Enable via agent configuration

To enable scanning of images within your Kubernetes cluster via the agent configuration, add a `container_scanning` configuration block to your agent
configuration with a `cadence` field containing a [CRON expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for when the scans are run.

```yaml
container_scanning:
  cadence: '0 0 * * *' # Daily at 00:00 (Kubernetes cluster time)
```

The `cadence` field is required. GitLab supports the following types of CRON syntax for the cadence field:

- A daily cadence of once per hour at a specified hour, for example: `0 18 * * *`
- A weekly cadence of once per week on a specified day and at a specified hour, for example: `0 13 * * 0`

NOTE:
Other elements of the [CRON syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12058_01/doc/doc.1014/e12030/cron_expressions.htm) may work in the cadence field if supported by the [cron](https://github.com/robfig/cron) we are using in our implementation, however, GitLab does not officially test or support them.

NOTE:
The CRON expression is evaluated in [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc) using the system-time of the Kubernetes-agent pod.

By default, operational container scanning does not scan any workloads for vulnerabilities.
You can set the `vulnerability_report` block with the `namespaces`
field which can be used to select which namespaces are scanned. For example,
if you would like to scan only the `default`, `kube-system` namespaces, you can use this configuration:

```yaml
container_scanning:
  cadence: '0 0 * * *'
  vulnerability_report:
    namespaces:
      - default
      - kube-system
```

For every target namespace, all images in the following workload resources are scanned:

- Pod
- ReplicaSet
- ReplicationController
- StatefulSet
- DaemonSet
- CronJob
- Job

### Enable via scan execution policies

To enable scanning of all images within your Kubernetes cluster via scan execution policies, we can use the
[scan execution policy editor](../../application_security/policies/scan-execution-policies.md#scan-execution-policy-editor)
To create a new schedule rule.

NOTE:
The Kubernetes agent must be running in your cluster to scan running container images

Here is an example of a policy which enables operational container scanning within the cluster the Kubernetes agent is attached to:

```yaml
- name: Enforce Container Scanning in cluster connected through my-gitlab-agent for default and kube-system namespaces
  enabled: true
  rules:
  - type: schedule
    cadence: '0 10 * * *'
    agents:
      <agent-name>:
        namespaces:
        - 'default'
        - 'kube-system'
  actions:
  - scan: container_scanning
```

The keys for a schedule rule are:

- `cadence` (required): a [CRON expression](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12058_01/doc/doc.1014/e12030/cron_expressions.htm) for when the scans are run
- `agents:<agent-name>` (required): The name of the agent to use for scanning
- `agents:<agent-name>:namespaces` (optional): The Kubernetes namespaces to scan. If omitted, all namespaces are scanned

NOTE:
Other elements of the [CRON syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E12058_01/doc/doc.1014/e12030/cron_expressions.htm) may work in the cadence field if supported by the [cron](https://github.com/robfig/cron) we are using in our implementation, however, GitLab does not officially test or support them.

NOTE:
The CRON expression is evaluated in [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc) using the system-time of the Kubernetes-agent pod.

You can view the complete schema within the [scan execution policy documentation](../../application_security/policies/scan-execution-policies.md#scan-execution-policies-schema).

## Configure scanner resource requirements

By default the scanner pod's default resource requirements are:

```yaml
requests:
  cpu: 100m
  memory: 100Mi
limits:
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 500Mi
```

You can customize it with a `resource_requirements` field.

```yaml
container_scanning:
  resource_requirements:
    requests:
      cpu: '0.2'
      memory: 200Mi
    limits:
      cpu: '0.7'
      memory: 700Mi
```

When using a fractional value for CPU, format the value as a string.

NOTE:
Resource requirements can only be set up using the agent configuration. If you enabled `Operational Container Scanning` through `scan execution policies`, you would need to define the resource requirements within the agent configuration file.

## View cluster vulnerabilities

To view vulnerability information in GitLab:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find the project that contains the agent configuration file.
1. Select **Operate > Kubernetes clusters**.
1. Select the **Agent** tab.
1. Select an agent to view the cluster vulnerabilities.

![Cluster agent security tab UI](../img/cluster_agent_security_tab_v14_8.png)

This information can also be found under [operational vulnerabilities](../../../user/application_security/vulnerability_report/index.md#operational-vulnerabilities).

NOTE:
You must have at least the Developer role.

## Scanning private images

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415451) in GitLab 16.4.

To scan private images, the scanner relies on the image pull secrets (direct references and from the service account) to pull the image.

## Limitations

In GitLab agent 16.9 and later, operational container scanning:

- handles Trivy reports of up to 100MB. For previous releases this limit is 10MB.
- is [disabled](../../../development/fips_compliance.md#unsupported-features-in-fips-mode) when the GitLab agent runs in `fips` mode.

## Troubleshooting

### `Error running Trivy scan. Container terminated reason: OOMKilled`

OCS might fail with an OOM error if there are too many resources to be scanned or if the images being scanned are large.
To resolve this, [configure the resource requirement](#configure-scanner-resource-requirements) to increase the amount of memory available.
