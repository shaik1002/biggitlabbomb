The Web IDE is an advanced editor with commit staging.
You can use the Web IDE to make changes to multiple files directly from the GitLab UI.
For a more basic implementation, see [Web Editor](../repository/web_editor.md).

To pair the Web IDE with a remote development environment, see [Remote development](../remote_development/index.md).

## Open the Web IDE

## Interactive web terminals

DETAILS:
**Status**: Beta

You cannot use interactive web terminals to interact with a runner.
However, you can use a terminal to install dependencies and compile and debug code.

## Extension marketplace

DETAILS:
**Status**: Beta

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/151352) in GitLab 17.0 [with flags](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `web_ide_oauth` and `web_ide_extensions_marketplace`. Disabled by default.
