# Organize work with projects

In GitLab, you can create projects to host
your codebase. You can also use projects to track issues, plan work,
collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and use
built-in CI/CD to deploy your app.

Projects can be available [publicly, internally, or privately](../public_access.md).
GitLab does not limit the number of private projects you can create.
