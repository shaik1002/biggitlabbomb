# Troubleshooting Code Suggestions

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium or Ultimate with GitLab Duo Pro
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

When working with GitLab Duo Code Suggestions, you might encounter the following issues.

## Code Suggestions are not displayed

If Code Suggestions are not displayed:

- Ensure you have [installed a supported IDE extension](supported_extensions.md#supported-editor-extensions)
- Ensure your administrator has [assigned you a seat](../../../../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md#assign-gitlab-duo-pro-seats).

If Code Suggestions are still not displayed, try the following troubleshooting steps.

### Code Suggestions not displayed in VS Code or GitLab Web IDE

If you are a self-managed user, ensure that Code Suggestions for the [GitLab Web IDE](../../../project/web_ide/index.md) are enabled. The same settings apply to VS Code as local IDE.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Extensions > GitLab Workflow**.
1. Select **Settings** (**{settings}**), and then select **Extension Settings**.
1. In **GitLab > AI Assisted Code Suggestions**, select the **Enable code completion**
   checkbox.

### View Code Suggestions logs

If the settings are enabled, but Code Suggestions are still not displayed, try the following steps:

1. In the GitLab Workflow **Extension Settings**, enable **GitLab: Debug**.
1. Open the extension log in **View > Output** and change the dropdown list to **GitLab Workflow** as the log filter. The command palette command is `GitLab: Show Extension Logs`.
1. Disable and re-enable the **Enable code completion** checkbox.
1. Verify that the debug log contains similar output:

```shell
2023-07-14T17:29:00:763 [debug]: Disabling code completion
2023-07-14T17:29:01:802 [debug]: Enabling code completion
2023-07-14T17:29:01:802 [debug]: AI Assist: Using server: https://cloud.gitlab.com/ai/v2/code/completions
```

To enable debug logging for the Language Server (LS), enable **GitLab â€º Ls: Debug**.

### Code Suggestions not displayed in Microsoft Visual Studio

1. Ensure you have properly [set up the extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-visual-studio-extension#setup).
1. From the **Tools > Options** menu, find the **GitLab** option. Ensure **Log Level** is set to **Debug**.
1. Open the extension log in **View > Output** and change the dropdown list to **GitLab Extension** as the log filter.
1. Verify that the debug log contains similar output:

```shell
14:48:21:344 GitlabProposalSource.GetCodeSuggestionAsync
14:48:21:344 LsClient.SendTextDocumentCompletionAsync("GitLab.Extension.Test\TestData.cs", 34, 0)
14:48:21:346 LS(55096): time="2023-07-17T14:48:21-05:00" level=info msg="update context"
```

## Code Suggestions return a 401 error

Code Suggestions [depend on a license token](../../../ai_features.md) that
[synchronizes your subscription](../../../../administration/license.md) with GitLab.

If the token expires, GitLab Duo code suggestions returns the following error
with status `401` when the token has expired:

```plaintext
Token validation failed in Language Server:
(Failed to check token: Error: Fetching Information about Personal Access Token
```

If GitLab has access to the [cloud server](../../../ai_features.md), try
[manually synchronizing your license](../../../../subscriptions/self_managed/index.md#manually-synchronize-your-subscription-details).

## Authentication troubleshooting

If the above steps do not solve your issue, the problem may be related to the recent changes in authentication,
specifically the token system. To resolve the issue:

1. Remove the existing personal access token from your GitLab account settings.
1. Reauthorize your GitLab account in VS Code using OAuth.
1. Test the Code Suggestions feature with different file extensions to verify if the issue is resolved.
