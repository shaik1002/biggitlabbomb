DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate

You can integrate Microsoft Teams notifications with GitLab and display notifications about GitLab projects

1. [Configure Microsoft Teams](#configure-microsoft-teams) to enable a webhook
   to listen for changes.
1. [Configure your GitLab project](#configure-your-gitlab-project) to push notifications
   to the Microsoft Teams webhook.

## Configure Microsoft Teams

To configure Microsoft Teams to listen for notifications from GitLab:

1. In Microsoft Teams, type `incoming webhook` in the search bar, and select
   **Incoming Webhook**:

1. Add a name for the webhook. The name is displayed next to every message that
   comes in through the webhook.
