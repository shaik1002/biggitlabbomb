</div>

To publish a website with Pages, you can use any static site generator,
like Gatsby, Jekyll, Hugo, Middleman, Harp, Hexo, or Brunch. You can also
publish any website written directly in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Pages does not support dynamic server-side processing, for instance, as `.php` and `.asp` requires.

## How it works

To use GitLab Pages, you must create a project in GitLab to upload your website's
files to. These projects can be either public, internal, or private.

GitLab always deploys your website from a specific folder called `public` in your
repository. When you create a new project in GitLab, a [repository](../repository/index.md)
becomes available automatically.

To deploy your site, GitLab uses its built-in tool called [GitLab CI/CD](../../../ci/index.md)
to build your site and publish it to the GitLab Pages server. The sequence of
scripts that GitLab CI/CD runs to accomplish this task is created from a file named
`.gitlab-ci.yml`, which you can [create and modify](getting_started/pages_from_scratch.md).
A specific `job` called `pages` in the configuration file makes GitLab aware that you're deploying a
GitLab Pages website.

You can either use the GitLab [default domain for GitLab Pages websites](getting_started_part_one.md#gitlab-pages-default-domain-names),
`*.gitlab.io`, or your own domain (`example.com`). In that case, you
must be an administrator in your domain's registrar (or control panel) to set it up with Pages.

The following diagrams show the workflows you might follow to get started with Pages.

<img src="img/new_project_for_pages_v12_5.png" alt="New projects for GitLab Pages">

## Access to your Pages site

If you're using GitLab Pages default domain (`.gitlab.io`), your website is
automatically secure and available under HTTPS. If you're using your own custom
domain, you can optionally secure it with SSL/TLS certificates.

If you're using GitLab.com, your website is publicly available to the internet.
To restrict access to your website, enable [GitLab Pages Access Control](pages_access_control.md).

If you're using a self-managed instance, your websites are published on your
own server, according to the [Pages settings](../../../administration/pages/index.md)
chosen by your sysadmin, who can make them public or internal.

## Administer GitLab Pages for self-managed instances

If you are running a self-managed instance of GitLab,
[follow the administration steps](../../../administration/pages/index.md) to configure Pages.

<i class="fa fa-youtube-play youtube" aria-hidden="true"></i> Watch a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD8c7WNcc6s) about how to get started with GitLab Pages administration.

### Configure GitLab Pages in a Helm Chart (Kubernetes) instance

To configure GitLab Pages on instances deployed via Helm chart (Kubernetes), use either:

- [The `gitlab-pages` subchart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/gitlab-pages/).
- [An external GitLab Pages instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-gitlab-pages/).

## Security for GitLab Pages

### Namespaces that contain `.`

If your username is `example`, your GitLab Pages website is located at `example.gitlab.io`.
GitLab allows usernames to contain a `.`, so a user named `bar.example` could create
a GitLab Pages website `bar.example.gitlab.io` that effectively is a subdomain of your
`example.gitlab.io` website. Be careful if you use JavaScript to set cookies for your website.
The safe way to manually set cookies with JavaScript is to not specify the `domain` at all:

```javascript
// Safe: This cookie is only visible to example.gitlab.io
document.cookie = "key=value";

// Unsafe: This cookie is visible to example.gitlab.io and its subdomains,
// regardless of the presence of the leading dot.
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=.example.gitlab.io";
document.cookie = "key=value;domain=example.gitlab.io";
```

This issue doesn't affect users with a custom domain, or users who don't set any
cookies manually with JavaScript.

### Shared cookies

By default, every project in a group shares the same domain, for example, `group.gitlab.io`. This means that cookies are also shared for all projects in a group.

To ensure each project uses different cookies, enable the Pages [unique domains](#unique-domains) feature for your project.

## Unique domains

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9347) in GitLab 15.9 [with a flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `pages_unique_domain`. Disabled by default.
> - [Enabled by default](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388151) in GitLab 15.11.
> - [Feature flag removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/122229) in GitLab 16.3.

By default, every new project uses pages unique domain. This is to avoid projects on the same group
to share cookies.

The project maintainer can disable this feature on:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. Deselect the **Use unique domain** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## Create multiple deployments

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated
**Status:** Experiment

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/129534) in GitLab 16.7 as an [experiment](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md) [with a flag](../../feature_flags.md) named `pages_multiple_versions_setting`, disabled by default.

FLAG:
On self-managed GitLab, by default this feature is not available. To make it available,
an administrator can [enable the feature flag](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named
`pages_multiple_versions_setting`. On GitLab.com and GitLab Dedicated, this feature is not available. This feature is not ready for production use.

Use the [`pages.path_prefix`](../../../ci/yaml/index.md#pagespagespath_prefix) CI/CD option to configure a prefix for the GitLab Pages URL.
A prefix allows you to differentiate between multiple GitLab Pages deployments:

- Main Pages deployment: a Pages deployment created with a blank `path_prefix`.
- Extra Pages deployment: a Pages deployment created with a non-blank `path_prefix`

The value of `pages.path_prefix` is:

- Converted to lowercase.
- Shortened to 63 bytes.
- Any character except numbers (`0-9`) and letter (`a-z`) is replaced with a hyphen (`-`).
- Leading and trailing hyphens (`-`) are removed.

### Example configuration

Consider a project such as `https://gitlab.example.com/namespace/project`. By default, its main Pages deployment can be accessed through:

- When using a [unique domain](#unique-domains): `https://project-namespace-uniqueid.gitlab.io/`.
- When not using a unique domain: `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project`.

If a `pages.path_prefix` is configured to the project branch names,
like `path_prefix = $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`, and there's a
branch named `username/testing_feature`, this extra Pages deployment would be accessible through:

- When using a [unique domain](#unique-domains): `https://project-namespace-uniqueid.gitlab.io/username-testing-feature`.
- When not using a unique domain: `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project/username-testing-feature`.

### Enable multiple deployments

To enable multiple GitLab Pages deployments:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Select **Deploy > Pages**.
1. Select **Use multiple deployments**.

### Limits

The number of extra deployments is limited by the root-level namespace. For specific limits for:

- GitLab.com, see [Other limits](../../gitlab_com/index.md#other-limits).
- Self-managed GitLab instances, see
  [Number of extra Pages deployments when using multiple deployments](../../../administration/instance_limits.md#number-of-extra-pages-deployments-when-using-multiple-deployments).

### Path clash

`pages.path_prefix` can take dynamic values from [CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md)
that can create pages deployments which could clash with existing paths in your site.
For example, given an existing GitLab Pages site with the following paths:

```plaintext
/index.html
/documents/index.html
```

If a `pages.path_prefix` is `documents`, that version will override the existing path.
In other words, `https://namespace.gitlab.io/project/documents/index.html` will point to the
`/index.html` on the `documents` deployment of the site, instead of `documents/index.html` of the
`main` deployment of the site.

Mixing [CI/CD variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md) with other strings can reduce the path clash
possibility. For example:

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Pages accessible through ${CI_PAGES_URL}/${PAGES_PREFIX}"
  variables:
    PAGES_PREFIX: "" # No prefix by default (master)
  pages:
    path_prefix: "$PAGES_PREFIX"
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH # Run on default branch (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "staging" # Run on master (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: '-stg-' # Prefix with -stg- for the staging branch
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" # Conditionally change the prefix for Merge Requests
      when: manual # Run pages manually on Merge Requests
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: 'mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID' # Prefix with the mr-<iid>, like `mr-123`
```

Some other examples of mixing [variables](../../../ci/variables/index.md) with strings for dynamic prefixes:

- `pages.path_prefix: 'mr-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG'`: Branch or tag name prefixed with `mr-`, like `mr-branch-name`.
- `pages.path_prefix: '-${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID}-'`: Merge request number prefixed and suffixed with `-`, like `-123-`.

### Use multiple deployments to create pages environments

You can use multiple GitLab Pages deployments to create a new [environment](../../../ci/environments/index.md).
For example:

```yaml
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Pages accessible through ${CI_PAGES_URL}/${PAGES_PREFIX}"
  variables:
    PAGES_PREFIX: "" # no prefix by default (master)
  pages:
    path_prefix: "$PAGES_PREFIX"
  environment:
    name: "Pages ${PAGES_PREFIX}"
    url: "${CI_PAGES_URL}/${PAGES_PREFIX}"
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "staging" # ensure to run on master (with default PAGES_PREFIX)
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: '-stg' # prefix with _stg for the staging branch
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event" # conditionally change the prefix on Merge Requests
      when: manual # run pages manually on Merge Requests
      variables:
        PAGES_PREFIX: 'mr-$CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID' # prefix with the mr-<iid>, like `mr-123`
```

With this configuration, users will have the access to each GitLab Pages deployment through the UI.
When using [environments](../../../ci/environments/index.md) for pages, all pages environments are
listed on the project environment list.

### Deployments deletion

#### Auto-clean

Extra Pages deployments, created by a merge request with a `path_prefix`, are automatically deleted when the
merge request is closed or merged.
