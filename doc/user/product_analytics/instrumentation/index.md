# Instrumentation

To instrument an application to send events to GitLab product analytics you can use one of the following language and platform specific tracking SDKs:

- [Browser SDK](browser_sdk.md)
- [Ruby SDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/gl-application-sdk-rb)
- [Python SDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/gl-application-sdk-python)
- [Node SDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/gl-application-sdk-node)
- [.NET SDK](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/analytics-section/product-analytics/gl-application-sdk-dotnet)
- [Snowplow SDK](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/collecting-data/collecting-from-own-applications/) is compatible, but not supported by GitLab.
