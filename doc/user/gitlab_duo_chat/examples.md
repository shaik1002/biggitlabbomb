# Ask GitLab Duo Chat

GitLab Duo Chat can help with a variety of questions. The following examples
represent some of the areas where GitLab Duo Chat can be the most helpful.

For additional practical examples, see the [GitLab Duo use cases](../gitlab_duo/use_cases.md).

- `Please explain this CI/CD job error message in the context of a Go project: build.sh: line 14: go command not found`

Alternatively, you can use [root cause analysis in CI/CD](../gitlab_duo/experiments.md#troubleshoot-failed-cicd-jobs-with-root-cause-analysis).

`/explain` is a special command to explain the selected code in your editor.
You can also add additional instructions to be considered, for example: `/explain the performance`
See [Use GitLab Duo Chat in VS Code](index.md#use-gitlab-duo-chat-in-vs-code) for more information.

- `/explain focus on the algorithm`
- `/explain the performance gains or losses using this code`

You can also use the Web UI to explain code in:

- A [file](../project/repository/code_explain.md).
- A [merge request](../project/merge_requests/changes.md#explain-code-in-a-merge-request).

## Refactor code in the IDE

DETAILS:
**Tier:** GitLab.com and Self-managed: For a limited time, Premium and Ultimate. In the future, [GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise](../../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md). <br>GitLab Dedicated: GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise.
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated
**Editors:** Web IDE, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs
**LLMs:** Anthropic: [`claude-3-sonnet-20240229`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview#claude-3-a-new-generation-of-ai)

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429915) for GitLab.com in GitLab 16.7.
> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429915) for self-managed and GitLab Dedicated in GitLab 16.8.

`/refactor` is a special command to generate a refactoring suggestion for the selected code in your editor.
You can include additional instructions to be considered. For example:

- Use a specific coding pattern, for example `/refactor with ActiveRecord` or `/refactor into a class providing static functions`.
- Use a specific library, for example `/refactor using mysql`.
- Use a specific function/algorithm, for example `/refactor into a stringstream with multiple lines` in C++.
- Refactor to a different programming language, for example `/refactor to TypeScript`.
- Focus on performance, for example `/refactor improving performance`.
- Focus on potential vulnerabilities, for example `/refactor avoiding memory leaks and exploits`.

## Write tests in the IDE

DETAILS:
**Tier:** GitLab.com and Self-managed: For a limited time, Premium and Ultimate. In the future, [GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise](../../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md). <br>GitLab Dedicated: GitLab Duo Pro or Enterprise.
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated
**Editors:** Web IDE, VS Code, JetBrains IDEs
**LLMs:** Anthropic: [`claude-3-sonnet-20240229`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview#claude-3-a-new-generation-of-ai)

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429915) for GitLab.com in GitLab 16.7.
> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/429915) for self-managed and GitLab Dedicated in GitLab 16.8.

`/tests` is a special command to generate a testing suggestion for the selected code in your editor.
You can also add additional instructions to be considered, for example: `/tests using the Boost.Test framework`
See [Use GitLab Duo Chat in VS Code](index.md#use-gitlab-duo-chat-in-vs-code) for more information.

- Use a specific test framework, for example `/tests using the Boost.test framework` (C++) or `/tests using Jest` (JavaScript).
- Focus on extreme test cases, for example `/tests focus on extreme cases, force regression testing`.
- Focus on performance, for example `/tests focus on performance`.
- Focus on regressions and potential exploits, for example `/tests focus on regressions and potential exploits`.

## Ask about errors

Programming languages that require compiling the source code may throw cryptic error messages. Similarly, a script or a web application could throw a stack trace. You can ask GitLab Duo Chat by prefixing the copied error message with, for example, `Please explain this error message:`. Add the specific context, like the programming language.

- `Explain this error message in Java: Int and system cannot be resolved to a type`
- `Explain when this C function would cause a segmentation fault: sqlite3_prepare_v2()`
- `Explain what would cause this error in Python: ValueError: invalid literal for int()`
- `Why is "this" undefined in VueJS? Provide common error cases, and explain how to avoid them.`
- `How to debug a Ruby on Rails stacktrace? Share common strategies and an example exception.`

## Ask follow up questions

You can ask follow-up questions to delve deeper into the topic or task at hand.
This helps you get more detailed and precise responses tailored to your specific needs,
whether it's for further clarification, elaboration, or additional assistance.

A follow-up to the question `Write a Ruby function that prints 'Hello, World!' when called` could be:

- `Can you also explain how I can call and execute this Ruby function in a typical Ruby environment, such as the command line?`

A follow-up to the question `How to start a C# project?` could be:

- `Can you also please explain how to add a .gitignore and .gitlab-ci.yml file for C#?`

## Ask about a specific issue

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/122235) for self-managed and GitLab Dedicated in GitLab 16.8.

You can ask about a specific GitLab issue. For example:

- `Generate a summary for the issue identified via this link: <link to your issue>`
- When you are viewing an issue in GitLab, you can ask `Generate a concise summary of the current issue.`
- `How can I improve the description of <link to your issue> so that readers understand the value and problems to be solved?`

NOTE:
If the issue contains a large amount of text (more than 40,000 words), GitLab Duo Chat might not be able to consider every word. The AI model has a limit to the amount of input it can process at one time.

- `What are the unique use cases raised by commenters in <link to your epic>?`

NOTE:
If the epic contains a large amount of text (more than 40,000 words), GitLab Duo Chat might not be able to consider every word. The AI model has a limit to the amount of input it can process at one time.
