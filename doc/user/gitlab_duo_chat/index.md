## Supported editor extensions

You can use GitLab Duo Chat in:

- The GitLab UI
- [The GitLab Web IDE (VS Code in the cloud)](../project/web_ide/index.md)
- VS Code, with the [GitLab Workflow extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow)
- JetBrains IDEs, with the [GitLab Duo Plugin for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22325-gitlab-duo)

Visual Studio support is
[under active development](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/-/epics/22).
You can express interest in other IDE extension support
[in this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/meta/-/issues/78).

NOTE:
If you have self-managed GitLab: GitLab Duo requires GitLab 17.2 and later for the best user experience and results. Earlier versions may continue to work, however the experience may be degraded.

## The context Chat is aware of

GitLab Duo Chat is sometimes aware of the context you're working in.
Other times, you must be more specific with your request.

In the GitLab UI, GitLab Duo Chat knows about these areas:

| Area          | How to ask Chat                                                                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Epics         | From the epic, ask about `this epic`, `this`, or the URL. From any UI area, ask about the URL.                   |
| Issues        | From the issue, ask about `this issue`, `this`, or the URL. From any UI area, ask about the URL.                 |
| Code files    | From the single file, ask about `this code` or `this file`. From any UI area, ask about the URL.                 |

In the IDEs, GitLab Duo Chat knows about these areas:

| Area    | How to ask Chat  |
|---------|------------------|
| Selected lines in the editor | With the lines selected, ask about `this code` or `this file`. Chat is not aware of the file; you must select the lines you want to ask about. |
| Epics   | Ask about the URL. |
| Issues  | Ask about the URL. |

In addition, in the IDEs, when you use any of the slash commands,
like `/explain`, `/refactor`, `/fix`, or `/tests,` Duo Chat has access to the
code you selected.

Duo Chat always has access to:

- GitLab documentation.
- General programming and coding knowledge.

We are continuously working to expand contextual awareness of Chat to include more types of content.

## Use GitLab Duo Chat in the GitLab UI

1. In the upper-right corner, select **GitLab Duo Chat**. A drawer opens on the right side of your screen.
1. Enter your question in the chat input box and press **Enter** or select **Send**. It may take a few seconds for the interactive AI chat to produce an answer.
1. Optional. Ask a follow-up question.

To ask a new question unrelated to the previous conversation, you might receive better answers
if you clear the context by typing `/reset` or `/clear` and selecting **Send**.

NOTE:
Only the last 50 messages are retained in the chat history. The chat history expires 3 days after last use.

## Use GitLab Duo Chat in the Web IDE
