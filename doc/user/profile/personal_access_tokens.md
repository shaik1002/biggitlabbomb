# Personal access tokens

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

Personal access tokens can be an alternative to [OAuth2](../../api/oauth2.md) and used to:

- Authenticate with the [GitLab API](../../api/rest/index.md#personalprojectgroup-access-tokens).
- Authenticate with Git using HTTP Basic Authentication.

In both cases, you authenticate with a personal access token in place of your password.

WARNING:
The ability to create personal access tokens without expiry was [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369122) in GitLab 15.4 and [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/392855) in GitLab 16.0. In GitLab 16.0 and later, existing personal access tokens without an expiry date are automatically given an expiry date of 365 days later than the current date. The automatic adding of an expiry date occurs on GitLab.com during the 16.0 milestone. The automatic adding of an expiry date occurs on self-managed instances when they are upgraded to GitLab 16.0. This change is a breaking change.

Personal access tokens are:

- Required when [two-factor authentication (2FA)](account/two_factor_authentication.md) or
  [SAML](../../integration/saml.md#password-generation-for-users-created-through-saml) is enabled.
- Used with a GitLab username to authenticate with GitLab features that require usernames. For example,
  [GitLab-managed Terraform state backend](../infrastructure/iac/terraform_state.md#use-your-gitlab-backend-as-a-remote-data-source)
  and [Docker container registry](../packages/container_registry/authenticate_with_container_registry.md),
- Similar to [project access tokens](../project/settings/project_access_tokens.md) and [group access tokens](../group/settings/group_access_tokens.md), but are attached
  to a user rather than a project or group.

NOTE:
Though required, GitLab usernames are ignored when authenticating with a personal access token.
There is an [issue for tracking](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212953) to make GitLab
use the username.

For examples of how you can use a personal access token to authenticate with the API, see the [API documentation](../../api/rest/index.md#personalprojectgroup-access-tokens).

Alternately, GitLab administrators can use the API to create [impersonation tokens](../../api/rest/index.md#impersonation-tokens).
Use impersonation tokens to automate authentication as a specific user.

## Create a personal access token

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660) in GitLab 15.3, default expiration of 30 days is populated in the UI.
> - Ability to create non-expiring personal access tokens [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/392855) in GitLab 16.0.

You can create as many personal access tokens as you like.

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Access Tokens**.
1. Select **Add new token**.
1. Enter a name and expiry date for the token.
   - The token expires on that date at midnight UTC.
   - If you do not enter an expiry date, the expiry date is automatically set to 365 days later than the current date.
   - By default, this date can be a maximum of 365 days later than the current date.
1. Select the [desired scopes](#personal-access-token-scopes).
1. Select **Create personal access token**.

Save the personal access token somewhere safe. After you leave the page,
you no longer have access to the token.

### Prefill personal access token name and scopes

You can link directly to the Personal Access Token page and have the form prefilled with a name and
list of scopes. To do this, you can append a `name` parameter and a list of comma-separated scopes
to the URL. For example:

```plaintext
https://gitlab.example.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens?name=Example+Access+token&scopes=api,read_user,read_registry
```

WARNING:
Personal access tokens must be treated carefully. Read our [token security considerations](../../security/token_overview.md#security-considerations)
for guidance on managing personal access tokens (for example, setting a short expiry and using minimal scopes).

## Revoke a personal access token

At any time, you can revoke a personal access token.

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Access Tokens**.
1. In the **Active personal access tokens** area, select **Revoke** for the relevant token.
1. On the confirmation dialog, select **Revoke**.

## Disable personal access tokens

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator.

In GitLab 15.7 and later, you can [use the application settings API to disable personal access tokens](../../api/settings.md#list-of-settings-that-can-be-accessed-via-api-calls).

### Disable personal access tokens for enterprise users

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/369504) in GitLab 16.11 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `enterprise_disable_personal_access_tokens`. Disabled by default.

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role in the group that the enterprise user belongs to.

Disabling the personal access tokens of a group's [enterprise users](../enterprise_user/index.md):

- Stops the enterprise users from creating new personal access tokens. This behavior applies
  even if an enterprise user is also an administrator of the group.
- Disables the existing personal access tokens of the enterprise users.

NOTE:
Disabling personal access tokens for enterprise users does not disable personal access tokens for [service accounts](service_accounts.md).

To disable the enterprise users' personal access tokens:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group or subgroup.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Permissions and group features**.
1. Under **Personal access tokens**, select **Disable personal access tokens**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

## View the last time a token was used

> - In GitLab 16.0 and earlier, token usage information is updated every 24 hours.
> - The frequency of token usage information updates [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/410168) in GitLab 16.1 from 24 hours to 10 minutes.

Token usage information is updated every 10 minutes. GitLab considers a token used when the token is used to:

- Authenticate with the [REST](../../api/rest/index.md) or [GraphQL](../../api/graphql/index.md) APIs.
- Perform a Git operation.

To view the last time a token was used:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Edit profile**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Access Tokens**.
1. In the **Active personal access tokens** area, view the **Last Used** date for
   the relevant token.

## Personal access token scopes

> - Personal access tokens no longer being able to access container or package registries [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387721) in GitLab 16.0.
> - `k8s_proxy` [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422408) in GitLab 16.4 [with a flag](../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `k8s_proxy_pat`. Enabled by default.
> - Feature flag `k8s_proxy_pat` [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/131518) in GitLab 16.5.

A personal access token can perform actions based on the assigned scopes.

WARNING:
If you enabled [external authorization](../../administration/settings/external_authorization.md), personal access tokens cannot access container or package registries. If you use personal access tokens to access these registries, this measure breaks this use of these tokens. Disable external authorization to use personal access tokens with container or package registries.

## When personal access tokens expire

Personal access tokens expire on the date you define, at midnight, 00:00 AM UTC.

- GitLab runs a check at 01:00 AM UTC every day to identify personal access tokens that expire in the next seven days. The owners of these tokens are notified by email.
- GitLab runs a check at 02:00 AM UTC every day to identify personal access tokens that expire on the current date. The owners of these tokens are notified by email.
- In GitLab Ultimate, administrators can
  [limit the allowable lifetime of access tokens](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#limit-the-lifetime-of-access-tokens). If not set, the maximum allowable lifetime of a personal access token is 365 days.
- In GitLab Free and Premium, the maximum allowable lifetime of a personal access token is 365 days.
- If you do not set an expiry date when creating a personal access token, the expiry date is set to the
  [maximum allowed lifetime for the token](../../administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#limit-the-lifetime-of-access-tokens).
  If the maximum allowed lifetime is not set, the default expiry date is 365 days from the date of creation.

### Personal access token expiry calendar

You can subscribe to an iCalendar endpoint which contains events at the expiry date for each token. After signing in, this endpoint is available at `/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens.ics`.

### Create a service account personal access token with no expiry date

You can [create a personal access token for a service account](../../api/groups.md#create-personal-access-token-for-service-account-user) with no expiry date. These personal access tokens never expire, unlike non-service account personal access tokens.

NOTE:
Allowing personal access tokens for service accounts to be created with no expiry date only affects tokens created after you change this setting. It does not affect existing tokens.

#### GitLab.com

Prerequisites:

- You must have the Owner role in the top-level group.

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your group.
1. Select **Settings > General > Permissions and group features**.
1. Clear the **Service account token expiration** checkbox.

You can now create personal access tokens for a service account user with no expiry date.

#### Self-managed GitLab

Prerequisites:

- You must be an administrator for your self-managed instance.

1. On the left sidebar, at the bottom, select **Admin Area**.
1. Select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Account and limit**.
1. Clear the **Service account token expiration** checkbox.

You can now create personal access tokens for a service account user with no expiry date.

## Create a personal access token programmatically

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

You can create a predetermined personal access token
as part of your tests or automation.

Prerequisites:

- You need sufficient access to run a
  [Rails console session](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session)
  for your GitLab instance.

To create a personal access token programmatically:

1. Open a Rails console:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-rails console
   ```

1. Run the following commands to reference the username, the token, and the scopes.

   The token must be 20 characters long. The scopes must be valid and are visible
   [in the source code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/auth.rb).

   For example, to create a token that belongs to a user with username `automation-bot` and expires in a year:

   ```ruby
   user = User.find_by_username('automation-bot')
   token = user.personal_access_tokens.create(scopes: ['read_user', 'read_repository'], name: 'Automation token', expires_at: 365.days.from_now)
   token.set_token('token-string-here123')
   token.save!
   ```

This code can be shortened into a single-line shell command by using the
[Rails runner](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#using-the-rails-runner):

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails runner "token = User.find_by_username('automation-bot').personal_access_tokens.create(scopes: ['read_user', 'read_repository'], name: 'Automation token', expires_at: 365.days.from_now); token.set_token('token-string-here123'); token.save!"
```

## Revoke a personal access token programmatically

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

You can programmatically revoke a personal access token
as part of your tests or automation.

Prerequisites:

- You need sufficient access to run a [Rails console session](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session)
  for your GitLab instance.

To revoke a token programmatically:

1. Open a Rails console:

   ```shell
   sudo gitlab-rails console
   ```

1. To revoke a token of `token-string-here123`, run the following commands:

   ```ruby
   token = PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token('token-string-here123')
   token.revoke!
   ```

This code can be shortened into a single-line shell command using the
[Rails runner](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#using-the-rails-runner):

```shell
sudo gitlab-rails runner "PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token('token-string-here123').revoke!"
```

## Clone repository using personal access token

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

To clone a repository when SSH is disabled, clone it using a personal access token by running the following command:

```shell
git clone https://<username>:<personal_token>@gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab.git
```

This method saves your personal access token in your bash history. To avoid this, run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://<username>@gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab.git
```

When asked for your password for `https://gitlab.com`, enter your personal access token.

The `username` in the `clone` command:

- Can be any string value.
- Must not be an empty string.

Remember this if you set up an automation pipeline that depends on authentication.

## Troubleshooting

### Unrevoke a personal access token

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated

If a personal access token is revoked accidentally by any method, administrators can unrevoke that token. By default, a daily job deletes revoked tokens at 1:00 AM system time.

WARNING:
Running the following commands changes data directly. This could be damaging if not done correctly, or under the right conditions. You should first run these commands in a test environment with a backup of the instance ready to be restored, just in case.

1. Open a [Rails console](../../administration/operations/rails_console.md#starting-a-rails-console-session).
1. Unrevoke the token:

   ```ruby
   token = PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token('<token_string>')
   token.update!(revoked:false)
   ```

   For example, to unrevoke a token of `token-string-here123`:

   ```ruby
   token = PersonalAccessToken.find_by_token('token-string-here123')
   token.update!(revoked:false)
   ```

## Alternatives to personal access tokens

For Git over HTTPS, an alternative to personal access tokens is to use an [OAuth credential helper](account/two_factor_authentication.md#oauth-credential-helpers).
