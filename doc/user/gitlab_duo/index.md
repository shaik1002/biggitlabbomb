# GitLab Duo

> - [First GitLab Duo features introduced](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/03/gitlab-ai-assisted-features/) in GitLab 16.0.
> - [Removed third-party AI setting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/136144) in GitLab 16.6.
> - [Removed support for OpenAI from all GitLab Duo features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10964) in GitLab 16.6.

GitLab Duo is a suite of AI-powered features that assist you while you work in GitLab.
These features aim to help increase velocity and solve key pain points across the software development lifecycle.

GitLab Duo features are available in [IDE extensions](../../editor_extensions/index.md) and the GitLab UI.
Some features are also available as part of [GitLab Duo Chat](../gitlab_duo_chat_examples.md).

GitLab is [transparent](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency).
As GitLab Duo features mature, the documentation will be updated to clearly state
how and where you can access these features.

> Starting October 17, 2024, customers with a Premium or Ultimate subscription must have a GitLab Duo add-on to access AI-powered features. For details, see [Changes to GitLab Duo Pro and GitLab Duo Enterprise access](../../subscriptions/subscription-add-ons.md#changes-to-gitlab-duo-pro-and-gitlab-duo-enterprise-access).
