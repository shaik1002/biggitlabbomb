# Integrated error tracking

DETAILS:
**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com

This guide provides you with basics of setting up integrated error tracking for
your project, using examples from different languages.

Error tracking provided by GitLab Observability is based on
[Sentry SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/). Check the
[Sentry SDK documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/) for more thorough
examples of how you can use Sentry SDK in your application.

## Enable error tracking for a project

Regardless of the programming language you use, you first need to enable error tracking
for your GitLab project. This guide uses the `GitLab.com` instance.

Prerequisites:

- You have a project for which you want to enable error tracking. To learn how to
  create a new one, see [Create a project](../user/project/index.md).

To enable error tracking with GitLab as the backend:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Go to **Settings > Monitor**.
1. Expand **Error Tracking**.
1. For **Enable error tracking**, select **Active**.
1. For **Error tracking backend**, select **GitLab**.
1. Select **Save changes**.
1. Copy the **Data Source Name (DSN)** string. You need it to configure your SDK implementation.

## Configure user tracking

To track the number of users affected by an error:

- In the instrumentation code, ensure each user is uniquely identified.
  You can use a user ID, name, email address, or IP address to identify a user.

For example, if you use
[Python](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/enriching-events/identify-user/),
you can identify a user by email:

```python
Sentry.setUser({ email: "john.doe@example.com" });
```

For more information about user identification, see the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/).

## View tracked errors

After your application emits errors to the Error Tracking API through the Sentry SDK,
those errors are available in the GitLab UI. To view them:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.
1. Go to **Monitor > Error Tracking** to see the list of open errors:
   ![MonitorListErrors](img/list_errors_v16_0.png)
1. Select an error to see the **Error details** view:

   ![MonitorDetailErrors](img/detail_errors_v16_0.png)

   This page shows more details of the exception, including:

   - Total number of occurrences.
   - Total users affected.
   - First seen: the date, and the commit (**{commit}**).
   - Last seen date, shown as a relative date. To see the timestamp, hover over the date with your mouse.
   - A bar graph of error frequency per hour. Hover over a bar to see the total number of errors in that hour.
   - A stack trace.

### Analyze an error's details

On the **Error details** page, point to the **Last seen** date to see a full
timestamp of the error. In this example, the error happened at 11:41 CEST:

![MonitorDetailErrors](img/last_seen_v16.10.png)

The **Last 24 hours** graph measures how many times this error occurred per hour.
By pointing at the `11 am` bar, the dialog shows the error was seen 239 times:

![MonitorDetailErrors](img/error_bucket_v16.10.png)

The **Last seen** field does not update until the full hour is complete, due to
the library used for the call
[`import * as timeago from 'timeago.js'`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/lib/utils/datetime/timeago_utility.js#L1).

## Emit errors

### Supported language SDKs & Sentry types

GitLab Error Tracking supports these event types:

| Language | Tested SDK client and version   | Endpoint   | Supported item types              |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Go       | `sentry-go/0.20.0`              | `store`    | `exception`, `message`            |
| Java     | `sentry.java:6.18.1`            | `envelope` | `exception`, `message`            |
| NodeJS   | `sentry.javascript.node:7.38.0` | `envelope` | `exception`, `message`            |
| PHP      | `sentry.php/3.18.0`             | `store`    | `exception`, `message`            |
| Python   | `sentry.python/1.21.0`          | `envelope` | `exception`, `message`, `session` |
| Ruby     | `sentry.ruby:5.9.0`             | `envelope` | `exception`, `message`            |
| Rust     | `sentry.rust/0.31.0`            | `envelope` | `exception`, `message`, `session` |

For a detailed version of this table, see
[issue 1737](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace/-/issues/1737).

Working examples for each of the
[supported language SDKs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/opstrace/opstrace/-/tree/main/test/sentry-sdk/testdata/supported-sdk-clients)
are available. Each example shows how to capture exceptions, events, or messages
with that SDK. For more in-depth documentation, see
[Sentry SDK's documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/) for that specific language.

## Rotate generated DSN

The Sentry Data Source Name (DSN), also known as a client key, is a secret.
Don't expose it to the public. If it is leaked or exposed, rotate the Sentry DSN.

Prerequisites:

- You need the numeric [project ID](../user/project/working_with_projects.md#access-a-project-by-using-the-project-id)
  for your project.

To rotate the Sentry DSN:

1. [Create an access token](../user/profile/personal_access_tokens.md#create-a-personal-access-token)
   with the `api` scope. Copy off this value, as you need it in future steps.
1. Use the [error tracking API](../api/error_tracking.md) to create a new Sentry DSN,
   replacing `<your_access_token>` and `<your_project_number>`:

   ```shell
   curl --request POST \
     --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
     --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<your_project_number>/error_tracking/client_keys"
   ```

1. Get the available client keys (Sentry DSNs). Ensure your newly-created Sentry DSN
   is in place. Run this command with the key ID of the old client key, replacing `<your_access_token>`
   and `<your_project_number>`:

   ```shell
   curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
     --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<your_project_number>/error_tracking/client_keys"
   ```

1. Delete the old client key.

   ```shell
   curl --request DELETE \
     --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <your_access_token>" \
     --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<your_project_number>/error_tracking/client_keys/<key_id>"
   ```

## Debug SDK issues

The majority of languages supported by Sentry expose a `debug` option as part
of initialization. The `debug` option can help you when you debug issues with
sending errors. Other options exist to output JSON before sending the data to the API.

## Data retention

GitLab has a 90-day retention limit for all errors.
