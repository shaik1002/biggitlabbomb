migration_job_name: BackfillFindingInitialPipelineId
description: >-
  We need to ensure that all existing vulnerability findings have
  their initial_finding_pipeline_id column backfilled before dropping
  the vulnerability_occurrence_pipelines table.

  We do not expect any circumstance under which a
  vulnerability_occurrence cannot have these fields fields filled in.
