migration_job_name: DeduplicateLfsObjectsProjects
description: >-
  This migration deduplicates lfs_objects_projects by lfs_object_id, project_id and repository_type.
  After the migration is finalized, we need to add a unique index on all three columns to ensure
  data consistency since the unique validation already exists at the model level.
