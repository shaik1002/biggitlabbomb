# REQUIRED FIELDS
#
- title: "Trigger jobs can mirror downstream pipeline status exactly"  # (required) Clearly explain the change, or planned change. For example, "The `confidential` field for a `Note` is deprecated" or "CI/CD job names will be limited to 250 characters."
  announcement_milestone: "15.9"  # (required) The milestone when this feature was first announced as deprecated.
  removal_milestone: "17.0"  # (required) The milestone when this feature is planned to be removed
  breaking_change: true  # (required) Change to false if this is not a breaking change.
  reporter: dhershkovitch  # (required) GitLab username of the person reporting the change
  stage: verify  # (required) String value of the stage that the feature was created in. e.g., Growth
  issue_url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/285493  # (required) Link to the deprecation issue in GitLab
  body: |  # (required) Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    In some cases, like when a downstream pipeline had the `passed with warnings` status, trigger jobs that were using [`strategy: depend`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#strategydepend) did not mirror the status of the downstream pipeline exactly. In GitLab 17.0 trigger jobs will show the exact same status as the the downstream pipeline. If your pipeline relied on this behavior, you should update your pipeline to handle the more accurate status.
#
