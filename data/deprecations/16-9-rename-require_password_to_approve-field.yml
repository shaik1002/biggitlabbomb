    In GitLab 16.7, we added the ability to re-authenticate with SAML SSO for the [Require user re-authentication to approve](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.html#require-user-re-authentication-to-approve) feature.

    For this reason, in GitLab 17.0, we are renaming the `require_password_to_approve` field to `require_reauthentication_to_approve` in the UI, API, and the database.
