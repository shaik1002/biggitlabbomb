    Starting in GitLab 18.0, [scan execution policies](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/scan_execution_policies.html)
    are limited to 10 `scan` actions per policy. You can't create new policies that exceed the limit, and you
    can't update existing policies if they exceed the limit. For any existing policy that exceeds the limit,
    only the policy's first 10 `scan` actions are run.

    You can configure a custom limit on self-managed instances with the `scan_execution_policies_action_limit` application setting.
