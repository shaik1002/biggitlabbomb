    The [pipeline subscriptions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/#trigger-a-pipeline-when-an-upstream-project-is-rebuilt) feature is deprecated in GitLab 17.6 and scheduled for removal in GitLab 18.0. Pipeline subscriptions are used to run downstream pipelines based on tag pipelines in upstream projects.

    Instead, use [CI/CD jobs with pipeline trigger tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#use-a-cicd-job) to trigger pipelines when another pipeline runs. This method is more reliable and flexible than pipeline subscriptions.
