    You can use the container registry REST API to [get a list of registry repository tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#list-registry-repository-tags). We plan to improve this endpoint, adding more metadata and new features like improved sorting and filtering.

    While offset-based pagination was already available for this endpoint, keyset-based pagination was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/432470) in GitLab 16.10 for GitLab.com only. This is now the preferred pagination method.

    Offset-based pagination for the [List registry repository tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#list-registry-repository-tags) endpoint is deprecated in GitLab 16.10 and will be removed in 18.0. Instead, use the keyset-based pagination.
