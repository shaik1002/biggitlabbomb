    In GitLab 14.4 we introduced the ability to [limit your project's CI/CD job token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#limit-your-projects-job-token-access) (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`) access to make it more secure. You can prevent job tokens **from your project's** pipelines from being used to **access other projects**. When enabled with no other configuration, your pipelines cannot access other projects. To use the job token to access other projects from your pipeline, you must list those projects explicitly in the **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access** setting's allowlist, and you must be a maintainer in all the projects.

    The job token functionality was updated in 15.9 with a better security setting to [allow access to your project with a job token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#add-a-group-or-project-to-the-job-token-allowlist). When enabled with no other configuration, job tokens **from other projects** cannot **access your project**. Similar to the older setting, you can optionally allow other projects to access your project with a job token if you list those projects explicitly in the **Allow access to this project with a CI_JOB_TOKEN** setting's allowlist. With this new setting, you must be a maintainer in your own project, but only need to have the Guest role in the other projects.

    The **Limit** setting was deprecated in 16.0 in preference of the better **Allow access** setting and **Limit** setting was disabled by default for all new projects. From this point forward, if the **Limit** setting is disabled in any project, it will not be possible to re-enable this setting in 16.0 or later.

    In 18.0, we will remove the **Limit** setting completely, and set the **Allow access** setting to enabled for all projects. This change ensures a higher level of security between projects. If you currently use the **Limit** setting, you should update your projects to use the **Allow access** setting instead. If other projects access your project with a job token, you must add them to the **Allow access** allowlist.

    To prepare for this change, users on GitLab.com or self-managed GitLab 15.9 or later can enable the **Allow access** setting now and add the other projects. It will not be possible to disable the setting in 18.0 or later.

    In 16.3, the names of these settings were changed to clarify their meanings: the deprecated **Limit CI_JOB_TOKEN access** setting is now called **Limit access _from_ this project**, and the newer **Allow access to this project with a CI_JOB_TOKEN** setting is now called **Limit access _to_ this project**.
